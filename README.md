## About To-Do List

The app is a utility tool that the users can use to plan their days and weeks. It gives the users a way to write down the tasks they want to achieve. The app saves the tasks to their local storage. They are also given the options to mark completed tasks, remove any task from the list, and the option to filter between completed and still active tasks.

The app retains the status of each task between loads; and it is designed to be responsive to different screen sizes.
